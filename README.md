# Project SDF

Project SDF is a project development framework created for PHP enthusiasts. The framework itself is compact, easy to maintain, and improvable.

> This version of the framework is not recommended for production use. It is still under development.\nEven though it is not recommended for production use, you can still use it for your personal projects.
> This version also includes a new orm library built-in, and has integrated code with Model class. Use \SDF\Sorm\Model instead of \SDF\Model.
