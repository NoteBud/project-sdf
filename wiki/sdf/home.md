# SDF Core Documentation

This is the home page of the sdf core documentation. Here you can find all the information you need to
start developing with the sdf core framework.

> I am currently working on the documentation. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me
> on [Twitter](https://x.com/devsimsek).

> SDF is built with modularity in mind. This means that you can use the core framework to build your
> own custom framework.
